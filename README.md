## The project and the dataset
This project is a data visualization exercise. It aims to investigate the factors leading to a match during a speed dating session. The data was collected over several speed dating waves involving students. The sessions took place between October, 16 2002 and April, 7 2004.

At the end of their four-minute date, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.

The dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process. These fields include: demographics, dating habits, self-perception across key attributes, beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate, and lifestyle information.

## Analysis and insights
Our work consists of an exploratory analysis into the dataset and an investigation of missing values, as well as feature selection. 
We particularly looked to understand the participants' expectations and factors that influence match making. 

Our analysis leads to several insights into the match making process. 
Attractiveness and sincerity seem to be the most important attributes in the participants' decision-making process. It should not come as a surprise since they only have 4 minutes to interact with their partners and get to know them. That may be the reason why there are some discrepancies between the attributes initially stated as desirable and the ones that mostly influence the outcome of the date. The 4-minute time span of each date can also explain the discrepancies in self-perception vs. perceived value. However, overall participants are good at predicting their partner's decision. It points to the fact that, even in merely 4 minutes, participants are aware of a mutual attraction, or lack thereof.
